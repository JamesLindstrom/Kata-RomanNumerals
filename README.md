# Kata-RomanNumerals
A Simple JavaScript program that converts Arabic numbers to Roman numerals and vice versa.

In order to run this Kata, simply open index.html in a modern browser. Enter values into the fields, or click the "run tests" button.

NOTE: Unlike most of my front end work, this JavaScript uses some recent features that may not be supported in some older browsers, particularly older versions of Safari and Internet Explorer.

NOTE 2: This code will not work properly if the three files are not kept in the same directory.
